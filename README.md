addthis
=======

This module, is a simplified version of the add this module.

The intent of this module, is to allow you a lot of flexibility with using add this.

Since add this allows you to use inline buttons, and has simplified the process for adding their widgets
you don't really need a complex module. This module does not attempt to theme for you, it lets you set the theme however you see fit.

###New in 1.1
This module has basic integration into views as a widget. You can add this to your Content view and adjust the basic workings of the module.
Remember, this is still for you to make as you please - but you have a little more integration now.

This also includes "theme('addthis_widget')" that allows you to have a little more to play with.
